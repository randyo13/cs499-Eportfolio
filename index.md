## Professional Self-Assessment

My time in the Computer Science program at SNHU has strengthened my skills in problem-solving, software design, algorithms, databases, and security. This ePortfolio highlights how I have applied these skills through three enhanced artifacts, each demonstrating growth in different areas of the field.  

For **Software Design & Engineering**, I enhanced the Animal Rescue Dashboard by refactoring UI logic into helper functions, improving error handling, and adding input validation. This made the application more modular, maintainable, and reliable. In **Algorithms & Data Structures**, I improved my Farkle Dice Game by restructuring the scoring logic into modular functions and fixing input buffer issues related to hot dice, resulting in more efficient and smoother gameplay. For **Databases**, I integrated MongoDB into my Reinforcement Learning Pirate Agent project to store and analyze training metrics, making the project data-driven and more adaptable for future improvements.  

Through these projects, I developed the ability to evaluate existing code, identify opportunities for improvement, and implement solutions that are both functional and maintainable. I also developed a stronger security mindset throughout these projects by implementing input validation and defensive programming practices, ensuring that my applications are more resilient to errors and potential vulnerabilities. I also strengthened my communication skills, ensuring I can explain technical concepts clearly to different audiences. These enhancements reflect my readiness to enter the software development field and my commitment to building secure, efficient, and user-friendly applications.
