Overview:

Develop a program that follows the rules of Farkle as described. On program start-up, it shall display the 
rules to the user as read from a text file submitted with the program. The user can then set up the game 
by entering the number of players. Any number below two shall ask the user to add more players. Once 
gameplay has started, rolling the dice should be performed using a random number generator for each 
of the six dice. After each player's roll, the score should be calculated based on selected scoring dice. 
Validate that the selection is valid and determine whether a reroll is allowed. Continue playing until a 
player reaches 10,000 points. Display a message declaring the winner.


Game Summary:

Farkle is a multiplayer dice game with a minimum of two players and no upper limit. The goal is to reach 
10,000 points first.


Points:

- A roll of a 1 is worth 100 points.
- A roll of a 5 is worth 50 points.
- Three of the same number rolled at the same time is worth 100x the face value.
  Example: three 2s = 200 points, three 5s = 500 points.
- Exception: three 1s = 1,000 points.


The Play:

- On a turn, a player rolls all six dice.
- Set aside any point dice (1s, 5s, or three of a kind).
- The player may reroll the remaining dice to earn more points or stop and bank their score.
- A "Farkle" occurs if no scoring dice are rolled. The player loses all points for that turn.
- If a player uses all six dice as scoring dice in one turn, they must roll all six again before stopping.
- The play continues to the left.


Entering the Game:

- A player must earn at least 1,000 points in a single turn before they officially enter the game.
- Until that happens, no points are recorded.
- After entering, a player may stop rolling at any time during their turns.


Strategy Tip:

- Players are not required to set aside all scoring dice.
- For example, keeping a 1 and rerolling a 5 may help set up a three-of-a-kind.
- At least one scoring die must be kept per roll.


Winning:

- A player must reach or exceed 10,000 points to trigger the final round.
- All other players get one final turn to beat that score.
- If no one succeeds, the player who crossed 10,000 wins.
- If someone beats that score, they win instead.
