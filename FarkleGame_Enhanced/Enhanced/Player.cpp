Description:

    This file implements the Player class, which is used to store and manage player
data for the Farkle game. Each Player object tracks its score and whether the player has
officially entered the game by scoring 1000 points or more in a single turn.

    The class provides methods to get and update the playerâ€™s score and entry status. These
methods are used by the Game class to determine turn outcomes, manage scoring, and enforce
game entry rules.

    During testing, the class functioned correctly as a simple data container. No logical errors
were observed, and integration with the Game class worked without issues.
